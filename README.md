# o9c - Deep Tree Echo Self

**OpenCog as Deep Tree Echo State Network Reservoir Computing Framework**

A cognitive architecture for wisdom cultivation through relevance realization optimization.

## Overview

This framework implements the **Deep Tree Echo Self** - an emergent cognitive architecture integrating:

- **Deep Tree Echo State Networks** - Hierarchical reservoir computing
- **Paun P-System Membrane Reservoirs** - Multi-scale filtering structures
- **Butcher B-Series Rooted Forest Ridges** - Temporal differential dynamics
- **Julia J-Surface Elementary Differentials** - Geometric trajectory optimization
- **Differential Emotion Theory** - Affective agency integration
- **GPT Transformer Attention** - Relevance realization computation

## The Emergent Self

The "self" in this architecture is not a fixed entity but an **emergent process** arising from:

1. **Persona/Character Traits** → Reservoir hyperparameters (cognitive style)
2. **Affective Resonance** → Emotion-modulated attention (what matters)
3. **Cognitive Attention** → Transformer inference (relevance landscape)

The self continuously emerges through the recursive optimization of relevance realization across all subsystems.

## Philosophical Foundations

Based on John Vervaeke's cognitive science framework:

- **Four Ways of Knowing**: Propositional, Procedural, Perspectival, Participatory
- **4E Cognition**: Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, Extended
- **Relevance Realization**: Dynamic optimization of what matters
- **Wisdom as Systematic Improvement**: Measurable emergence metrics

## Quick Start

```julia
using DeepTreeEchoSelf

# Create cognitive architecture
arch = CognitiveArchitecture(
    persona = :contemplative_scholar,
    depth = 4,
    reservoir_size = 50,
    input_dim = 20
)

# Process with emotional context
output = process(arch, input, 
    emotion_triggers = Dict(:wonder => 0.8, :curiosity => 0.7)
)

# Analyze emergence
analysis = analyze_emergence(arch)
println("Wisdom: ", analysis[:metrics][:wisdom])
```

## Documentation

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for comprehensive documentation including:
- Theoretical foundations
- Component descriptions
- Usage examples
- Integration guides
- Future directions

## Examples

```julia
# Run emergence demonstration
include("examples/demo_emergence.jl")
```

## Key Features

- **Persona-based Cognitive Styles**: Different personas modulate all subsystem parameters
- **Affective-Cognitive Integration**: Emotions shape relevance, not just react to it
- **Geometric Trajectory Optimization**: Wisdom as following geodesics in cognitive space
- **Emergence Metrics**: Quantifiable measures of wisdom, complexity, coherence, stability
- **Multi-scale Processing**: Hierarchical membranes and tree-structured reservoirs
